# Raven Nav

Bevy + Avain Navigation

Creating this to get a better understanding of navmeshes for myself, and I only care about avian and 3d.

# Notes

About have this working, then [avian_navmesh](https://github.com/janhohenheim/avian_navmesh) dropped.  Going to stop working for a bit see how avian_navmesh works out.

## Acknowledgements

Codebase is derived from the following, and you should go use them most likely:

- [oxidized_navigation](https://github.com/TheGrimsey/oxidized_navigation)
- [recastnavigation](https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation/)
- [landmass](https://github.com/andriyDev/landmass)

# Notes

Things I should make PR for upstream:
  Heightfield: use parry's 'map_elements_in_local_aabb' in voxelization::build_heightfield_tile
