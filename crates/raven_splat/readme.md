Started from [bevy_triplanar_splatting](https://github.com/bonsairobo/bevy_triplanar_splatting)

It was based on bevy 0.14, its assets used odd resolution for array_textures and I couldnt load them on linux, think author was on a mac.

When it was written bevy didnt have `ExtendedMaterial` yet so alot of `StandardMaterial` is was duplicated.  I also wanted to support GPU-Driven Rendering.
