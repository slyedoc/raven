# Raven Terrain

This is a fresh start for terrain generation in bevy

## Notes

Ideas from my previous projects

- [Simple Compute Shader](https://github.com/slyedoc/bevy_sly_compute/blob/2d7f067ba47c29dd068527398b2e7f14e16ef799/examples/terrain.rs#L213)
- [Full Blown Compute Workflow](https://github.com/slyedoc/orbit/blob/main/crates/bevy_terrain/src/lib.rs)

While ideal to use the gpu, building workflow like this was pain, and the fork of bevy for macro mod was a pain, shouldn't need that now days, see [gpu_readback](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/e6ba9a6d181ad20320e4dadc26575b7f5a6c6f94/examples/shader/gpu_readback.rs#L22)
